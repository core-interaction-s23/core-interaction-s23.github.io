# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Let’s do some introductions!
	- How about your name, pronouns, something about yourself you’d want us to know.
	- More for me, tell us a bit about yourself as a designer and your experience with coding.
- Then we’ll go through [our (lab) syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qyoAy0IGI4u2gmBAw6ZepMuHco0_VZf6MGGW97Y8J4/).
- Let‘s take a break somewhere in here, help me remember.
- We’ll get our (coding) house in order:
	- Download [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com).
	- And the [Live Server plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).
	- Sign up for [GitHub](https://github.com/join), if you haven’t already.
	- Download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com).
	- Let’s write some code! We’ll do it together. It’ll be okay.
	- Make a *“Hello, world!”* home repo/project and host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). (So many GitHub things.)
- If we have time, we might do an [HTML lecture/refresher](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/html/). Maybe that waits until next week? Maybe people don’t need it? We will see how it goes!

## For Homework

- Fill out the [lab class list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tke1rUsNxPxmxSvqH5jCl5NTkm2-lQE8FxP8vLOEUYc) to help me learn your names. I apologize in advance for being bad at this!
- Make your home repo/project, ex: [yourname.github.io](https://mfehrenbach.github.io), as we did in class.
- Spruce it up! Do something fun, unique, and to show me what you can do in HTML/CSS/JS.
- Share your link in our [#lab channel](https://discord.gg/JavYhzJz) on Discord.
