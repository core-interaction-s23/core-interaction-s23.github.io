# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Let’s first check in with our schedule.

- Then we’ll review a few of your *SVG!* assignments. Volunteers, please!
<!-- Tanishka. -->

- Today’s going to be a double-feature, going more in-depth on [flexbox](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/flexbox/) and [(CSS) grid](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/grid/).

*We’ll take our break around 10:15.*

- Onto our next assignment, *Grid!*&thinsp;:
	- We’ll be focusing on using CSS grid in two ways:
		- For *overall layout*—with `grid-template-areas`
		- For a *regular list*—with the `repeat` function
	- Your *overall layout* should have at least four *semantic* elements: `header`, `main`, `aside`, and `footer`.
		- The topic/content for these is up to you, but the areas should be visually distinct.
		- The layout grid should be responsive to at least three arrangements—mobile, tablet, and desktop—and should use [CSS variables](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/responsive/#briefly-css-variables) to achieve this.
		- Use [the inspector](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/inspector/) to check your work here! Including on larger-than-your-laptop sizes.
		- One of these elements should demonstrate `fixed` or `sticky` positioning, or an internal scroll with `overflow`. Make it feel “webby.”
	- Your *regular list* should have at least 25 items—these can be words, text, image, color, whatever you prefer—again, make sure they are distinct.
		- This grid should live in your `main` layout area.
		- Same *minimum* of three breakpoints—the relative/size feeling of the grid should be consistent across widths.
		- It should have more than one column on mobile.
		- Have one item be “featured” in some way, distinct from the others.
	- This isn’t meant to be a content exercise, so don’t “spin your wheels” too much there. You can think of this as a *wireframe*, if that is helpful.
	- I am looking for experimentation/engagement with your layouts! I don’t want 16 , identical single-column-then-[holy-grail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_grail_(web_design)) layouts.



## For next week

- Finish your *Grid!* assignment! Please make sure you have met all the requirements here—I will be checking!
- As is custom, “Discord it” when you are done.
