# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Let’s glance at our schedule, again.

- And maybe look at a couple of your *Grid!* assignments.

- Our main jam for today will be a “code along,” working with the [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/). We’re going to get a dataset and do some kind of basic visualization from it:

	- I’d like to do this “live” with you all, instead of going through something pre-prepared! That way you can see how you might navigate your way through something like this.

	- There will probably be lots of mistakes/muddling and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript)! That is how *this* designer writes his JavaScript. Bear with.

	- We’ll be using the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw), as one does. You could use your own dataset, if you have already decided on it.

	- This dataset is small enough (~3,000 entries, or *rows*) that we can use the whole/raw set directly. If you’re working with a larger dataset (some of these have [millions of rows](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9)), you might need to [filter](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/filtering.html) or [query](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/), to get something smaller/workable. (You could also [paginate](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/paging.html), but that’d get complicated for overall comparisons/visualizations.)

	- Here’s a little agenda:

- For more complicated visualizations, you could use [D3](https://d3js.org) (for *Data-Driven Documents*)—a popular JavaScript library made for this sort of thing. It uses JS to construct HTML/CSS (and SVG) elements, just as we have manually!

- It might be helpful to look at this [Graph Gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html) to get an idea of how it could be used. But it will depend on your data and the story you are trying to tell!
