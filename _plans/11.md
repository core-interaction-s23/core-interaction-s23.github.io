# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Let’s glance at our schedule, again.

- Stuff I noticed in your *Grid!* assignments:

	- You need to add the meta element to make your pages responsive: \
		`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` 😮
	- You were meant to change your `grid-template-areas` and `repeat` for all three breakpoints. 🫤
	- Relatedly, you need to check your responsive layouts in [the Inspector](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/inspector/#device-mode)! 😩


- Our main jam for today will be a “code along,” working with the [NYC Open Data](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/). We’re going to get a dataset and do some kind of basic visualization from it:

	- I’d like to do this “live” with you all, instead of going through something pre-prepared! That way you can see how you might navigate your way through something like this.

	- There will probably be lots of mistakes/muddling and [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/javascript)! That is how *this* designer writes his JavaScript. Bear with.

	- We’ll be using the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw), as one does. You could use your own dataset, if you have already decided on it.

	- This dataset is small enough (~3,000 entries, or *rows*) that we can use the whole/raw set directly. If you’re working with a larger dataset (some of these have [millions of rows](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/311-Service-Requests-from-2010-to-Present/erm2-nwe9)), you might need to [filter](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/filtering.html) or [query](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/queries/), to get something smaller/workable. (You could also [paginate](https://dev.socrata.com/docs/paging.html), but that’d get complicated for overall comparisons/visualizations.)

	- Here’s a little agenda:

		- Go get the JSON
		- Talk about filters/queries (logic in API or in JS)
		- Pull it in with `fetch` (note the `limit=`)
		- Set up debugging in VS Code (from URL)
		- Briefly, could render out items (as in the [collection](https://github.com/core-interaction-s23/collection) example)
		- Count squirrels by color (`forEach`, `++`)
		- Pass these values to the DOM (with `setProperty`)
		- Construct a bar-chart from these (using `flex` and `calc`) \
		 

	*We’ll take our break around 10:15.*

	- Let’s keep going, to make this interactive:

		- Add a dropdown menu for shift (`form`, `label`, `select`)
		- Watch for changes on it (with `oninput`)
		- Update the bar-chart (using `filter`)

- *In case we are running behind, I did prep a [demo repo](https://github.com/core-interaction-s23/squirrel-census).*

- For more complicated visualizations, you could use [D3](https://d3js.org) (for *Data-Driven Documents*)—a popular JavaScript library made for this sort of thing. It uses JS to construct HTML/CSS (and SVG) elements, just as we have manually!

- It might be helpful to look at this [Graph Gallery](https://d3-graph-gallery.com/index.html) to get an idea of how it could be used. But it will depend on your data and the story you are trying to tell!



## For next week

- We’ll use progress on your project as your next assignment!
- Get your dataset pulled into your project with `fetch` and display the information there—either as individual items (our previous [collection](https://github.com/core-interaction-s23/collection) example), or in aggregate (like [today’s demo](https://github.com/core-interaction-s23/squirrel-census)).
- Don’t worry too much about the styles—I primarily want to see you pulling in and working (in some way) with the data.
- “Discord us” a link when you are done, as we do.
