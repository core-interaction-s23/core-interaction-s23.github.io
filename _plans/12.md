## Agenda

- Let’s look at that schedule, as we do.

- As of writing, many of you didn’t send anything for your assignment due today. Next week will build off of it, so you’ll need to start there. I’ll remind you that this one of our *8* assignments, so far—and this class’s grade is mostly the assignments.

- I’m seeing mostly render-each-data-entry (like the [collection](https://github.com/core-interaction-s23/collection) example) approaches for your project, so far. This is fine, but it is hard to *tell a story* this way—I want you to think about summarizing/visualizing info across your dataset.

- We’re going to spend most of today going through some [additional, advanced CSS](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/advanced-css/).

*We’ll take our break around 10:15, as we do.*

- I’d like to spend a bit of time looking at [last week’s demo](https://github.com/core-interaction-s23/squirrel-census) again—which has some changes around the `fetch`—to make the API less annoying, hopefully.

	- Talk about [*cacheing*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache)
	- And the dynamic/higher limit
	- Lil’ bit on [filter](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)
	- Could redraw it as a horizontal bar chart, talk about ranges

## For next week

- Complete the assignment that was due today, if you haven’t already.

- I would like you to add some basic interactivity to your project data!

	- This could be filtering your data with a `form` (like in the demo).

	- You could also [add a class](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/javascript/#addingremoving-aclass) when clicking something, or [watching the scroll](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/javascript/#watching-for-scrolling).

	- And then make this interactivity less abrupt with [CSS transitions](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/advanced-css/#transitions).

	- And share it on the Discord!

- Next week we will have our 1:1 check-ins for your project, so come prepared with your questions—conceptual, design, or technical!
