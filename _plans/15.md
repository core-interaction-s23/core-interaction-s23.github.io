# Tuesday, Studio

## Agenda
1. [Final Project Presentations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TK5Zl_JNUTyqtywmyPBU79xC6FC_tuHIo0U6Vl_5wlQ/edit?usp=sharing)



# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- First off, everyone share their projects on Discord (if you haven’t already)! I want to look through them while you…

- …take your “skills test”!

    - There are 16 multiple-choice questions. Choose the “most right” answer, if you aren’t sure! (And you can always guess.) Clearly mark your answer, of course.

    - This is “closed book,” so I shouldn’t see any laptops open or phones out.

    - I think you should be able to answer all of these, from what we’ve covered in class. Take your time and reason through it. I’m not trying to penalize you here; just show me what you know!

    - If this proves too difficult, collectively, I may curve your scores. Don’t stress.

    - Don’t forget your name!

*We’ll take our break after everyone is done.*

*To close out our course, I thought we might run through some “things we haven’t talked about but you should probably have at least heard of”:*

- Git/GitHub and collaboration:

    - *Branches*

        We’ve been using [Git](https://git-scm.com) (via GitHub) primarily for solo, linear software development—but that is rarely how you work, especially at scale. One of Git’s core concepts is a [*branch*](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches) (think *tree* metaphors). These are new/separate versions of your entire repository—which [you create](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/making-changes-in-a-branch/managing-branches) (people say *branch*, as a verb) off the `main`  *trunk*. When you do this to a separate repo it is called [*forking*](http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/difference-between-fork-and-branch/).

        Figma has started to [adopt this concept](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/branching-in-figma/best-practices-when-using-branches/), too!

    - *Merges*

        You might use these to develop a new feature, or to fix a bug, before you [*merge*](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/git-merge) these back into `main`. Sometimes, someone else will have edited the same lines of code you were working on, in the meantime, and you’ll have to resolve a [*merge conflict*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HosPml1qkrg)—deciding whose work to take. (It can get messy.)

    - *PRs (Pull Requests)*

        When you are working on big software projects/repos with multiple people—and when you don’t want to break `main` with hasty merges—you *push* your code up to GitHub and [open a *pull request*](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) (everyone says *PR*). This shows all your combined commits together, and allows your team [to review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgbCcBNZcdQ&pp=ygUOInB1bGwgcmVxdWVzdCI%3D) and approve your work.



- Working with devs/teams/on bigger stuff

    - *CMS*

        [Content management systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system) are software, usually running on a server, that helps create, edit, and publish (in our context) web pages; ex: [WordPress](https://wordpress.com), [Wix](https://www.wix.com), [Webflow](https://webflow.com), [Cargo](https://cargo.site). These separate your content from your HTML templates, for easy re-use and structuring, and generate/output pages dynamically.

        Relatedly there are [static site generators](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/performance/static-site-generator/), which run *locally* to construct sites from content and templates; ex: [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com), [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev). Any website past a single page can benefit from these!

    - *Agile*

        A popular way to structure software project management. Many product teams will use [*Agile*](https://www.atlassian.com/agile) as a way of prioritizing tasks—working in so called *sprints* (often two weeks) to deliver features incrementally rather than all at once.

        One way that Agile is practiced is with a [*kanban* board](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards) (from [Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban)), a visual way of organizing tasks into discrete phases of work so that team members understand where different *stories* (or *tickets*/*tasks*) are in the queue. [Many](https://www.atlassian.com/) [tools](https://linear.app/) [are](https://clickup.com) built around this methodology.

    - *Redlining*

        Often a completed design in Figma isn’t enough for [*handoff*](https://uxplanet.org/a-complete-guide-to-executing-a-great-design-to-development-handoff-4bd545be9416) to a developer for implementation. There can be ambiguities in your design that *you* may have thought through, but need more explanation than the visual on its own. This could be how you expect an element to behave responsively, or maybe you have a specific dimension in mind—some of this is handled by the [*Inspect panel*](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360055203533-Use-the-Inspect-panel).

        [Redlining](https://www.uxbeginner.com/glossary/redlining/) (not to be confused with [its other meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redlining)) is the term for when you *mark up* or *annotate* your designs with information—key measurements or other important behaviors/traits. This forms the *spec* that a dev should implement.

    - *Bus factor / bus count*

        On small product teams, certain individuals may be the only ones who understand how a certain feature works, or is implemented. The phrase [*bus factor*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) (or *bus count*) is used in the lens of risk management—to make sure the product/team can continue if anyone gets “hit by a bus.”

        Always try to avoid a *bus count* of one! Not just because of busses, but to distribute knowledge and understanding (and stress) among your team.

    - *Technical (and design) debt*

        Very often, products have to make trade-offs between design or code quality to meet deadlines, or to handle [*scope creep*](https://asana.com/resources/what-is-scope-creep). These decisions sometimes come at the expense of either side—sacrificing the most nuanced design, or giving up on the most pristine, sturdy code.

        [*Technical debt*](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/software-development/technical-debt) (or the analogous *design debt*) are the accumulation of these short-term decisions—where you have postponed doing it the right way. Like other forms of debt, these often *compound* over time—if you don’t pay them down/address them as you move forward.

    - *Dogfooding*

        Often the best way—or at least the *first* way—to make sure your product is up to snuff is by using and testing it *yourself*. This term is called [*dogfooding*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/business/dogfooding.html), or *eating your own dog food*. (There are debates on the [etymology](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2006/03/s3005/13rRUygBwg0)). An example is Apple, pushing desktop publishing in 1980, [outlawing typewriters internally](https://archive.org/details/Apple_Memo_No_Typewriters).



- Accessibility

    - *A11y*

        [*A11y*](https://www.a11yproject.com/) is a catch-all term for accessibility. Like [*i18n*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/API/i18n) (for *internationalization*), the abbreviation *a11y* is shorthand for ensuring that your product is as inclusive as possible.

    - *ARIA labels*

        While the best and most-basic way of writing accessible websites is to start with semantic DOM elements, sometimes there isn’t an appropriate one—this is where [*ARIA*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) (*Accessible Rich Internet Applications*) labels come in. These are additional attributes you can add to an HTML element which help a screenreader to convey the meaning of your content.

    - *VoiceOver / TalkBack / Narrator*

        Commonly-used assistive technologies: Apple’s [*VoiceOver*](https://www.apple.com/accessibility/vision/), Google’s (Android) [*TalkBack*](https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/topic/3529932?hl=en&ref_topic=9078845&sjid=8833292709650514472-NA) and Microsoft’s [*Narrator*](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/complete-guide-to-narrator-e4397a0d-ef4f-b386-d8ae-c172f109bdb1). Some disabled folks use [other screen-readers](https://www.freedomscientific.com/products/software/jaws/), but these are a good, built-in start.



- Frameworks and approaches

    - *Bootstrap*

        The framework *du jour* for a long time—[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) was created by Twitter as a way of quickly creating web apps. Because frameworks have to have opinions to work the downside is that many websites created using this have a certain “made with Bootstrap” vibe. In a small environment you’ll likely be working with an existing (*legacy*) framework or component library, so understanding these trade-offs is important.

    - *SASS / SCSS*

        As you may have noticed, writing CSS can be repetitive and tiresome. Back in 2006, some (very opinionated) folks developed [*SASS*](https://sass-lang.com/) (*Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets*)—which is a CSS preprocessor. It is its own language/syntax (mostly based on CSS) which gets *compiled* (processed) into normal CSS, which your browser understands. [*SCSS*](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax) is a slightly different—but much more popular—variant of *SASS*. (When people say *SASS*, they usually mean *SCSS*!)

        More recently, some of the utility/need for SASS has been obviated by CSS adopting similar features, like [custom properties (variables)](/topic/responsive/#briefly-css-variables) and soon, [CSS nesting](https://webkit.org/blog/13813/try-css-nesting-today-in-safari-technology-preview/).

    - *BEM*

        You might have also noticed that coming up with CSS class names can be difficult, as well—and only gets worse as your projects get larger. [*BEM*](https://en.bem.info/methodology/) (*Block, Element, Modifier*) is a commonly-used nomenclature methodology/practice to deal with this (and also avoid [*specificity*](/topic/css/#specificity) problems).

        It follows [the pattern](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/) `.block__element--modifier` in classnames—and these double separators (`__` and `--`) are sometimes seen even in non-*BEM-y* contexts.

    - *Tailwinds / Atomic / utility CSS*

        An alternative approach to CSS naming—following a [*utility class*](https://css-irl.info/a-year-of-utility-classes/) methodology. This uses many small, descriptive or directly-property-mapped names (like `.red` or `.flex`) across any elements. This approach is sometimes [*kleenexed*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_trademark) as [atomic CSS](https://acss.io) or [Tailwinds](https://tailwindcss.com).



And maybe if we have time, and folks want to… “ask me anything” Q/A session?

- Doesn’t have to be technical! In fact, I prefer non-technical.
- We could talk about internships/jobs, money, school, inspiration. 
- There are no dumb or off-topic questions!



## ~~For next week~~ One last thing

- It you haven’t already, please fill out your course evaluations! You should have an *Access Evaluation Kit* link somewhere in your [MyNewSchool](https://my.newschool.edu).

- These are genuinely helpful to me! Also, they are anonymous and don’t influence your grades.

- That’s it! Thank you all for your time and attention this semester; I hope you all have a wonderful summer and that our paths cross again.
