# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- First off, everyone share their projects on Discord (if you haven’t already)! I want to look through them while you…

- …take your “skills test”!

    - There are 16 multiple-choice questions. Choose the “most right” answer, if you aren’t sure! (And you can always guess.) Clearly mark your answer, of course.

    - I think you should be able to answer all of these, from what we’ve covered in class. Take your time and reason through it. I’m not trying to penalize you here; just show me that you’ve been paying attention!

    - This is “closed book,” so I shouldn’t see any laptops open or phones out.

    - If this proves too difficult, collectively, I may curve your scores.

*We’ll take our break after everyone is done.*
