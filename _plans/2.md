## For Homework
1. Keep iterating on your sketches. Start thinking about what the project will look like from page to page. If you did physical sketches this week, do digital sketches for next week. If you've started on digital, maybe try thinking a bit about prototyping in code. Really focus on the typography and layout of your site.
2. Read: [My Website is a Shifting House Next to a River of Knowledge, by Laurel Schwulst](https://thecreativeindependent.com/essays/laurel-schwulst-my-website-is-a-shifting-house-next-to-a-river-of-knowledge-what-could-yours-be/)

# Friday, Lab

## Agenda
- We’ll start by looking at some of your landing pages
	- Volunteers! Otherwise we will call on folks.
	<!-- Michelle, Iris, and Julie. -->
- Let’s briefly talk about [file naming](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/101TEdtacOFZhCwebijcJaX0h1BpDwhAm2SJhE3jW89c/edit#slide=id.g331f24f572_4_0). In short:
	- Stick to lowercase. Some things are “case sensitive,” others aren’t—but it isn’t worth knowing what is.
	- Don’t use spaces in web filenames—use underscores (_) or hyphens (-).
	- We’re using Git for versioning—so don’t add revision/version numbers or dates to your names.
	- When you change a filename, you change the link! So old links will break.
- Now we’re going to do an [HTML refresher](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/html/).

*We’ll probably take a break here.*

- We’re going to spend the latter half of class starting our first proper assignment, *Semantics!*.
	- Create a folder in your repo, then make an `index.html` HTML file in it.
	- Gather a collection of texts—favorite quotes, street names in the Village, directions from here to somewhere, all the meals you ate last week, every cousin’s name, all your grade and highschool teachers in the order you had them. (Surprise us all here.)
	- You should have maybe a dozen—enough to make sense as a *collection*. Use these to construct your page.
	- You are only allowed to use [HTML elements](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/html/#what-are-elements) to do this. No CSS, not even a reset! Or JavaScript.
	- You must use 6 different tag types! The more variety, the better.
	- Include a good `title` in your `head`.
	- Document/explain what each tag does in HTML comments above the element.
	- Also include a sentence or two explaining your collection and how it all ties together.
	- Add a link to this page on your repo’s main/landing page.
- I will start us off, and then while folks are working will be available for questions/help.



## For next week

- You’re going to finish your *Semantics!* assignment.
- Share a link to it in the lab channel when you are done. Sending the link is “turning it in!”
- Spend some time organizing your landing page. We are going to keep adding to it, so set up some [semantic containers](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/html/#common-elements) and [lists](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/html/#lists). Also make it look nice!
- If you didn’t already, complete your entry in the [lab class list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Tke1rUsNxPxmxSvqH5jCl5NTkm2-lQE8FxP8vLOEUYc).
