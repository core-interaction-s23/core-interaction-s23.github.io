## For Homework
1. Keep iterating on your sketches. Start thinking about what the project will look like from page to page. If you did physical sketches this week, do digital sketches for next week. If you've started on digital, maybe try thinking a bit about prototyping in code. Really focus on the typography and layout of your site.
