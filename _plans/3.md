# Tuesday, Studio
## Agenda
1. Share a design that you're inspired by! - Helen
2. Reading discussion, led by Michelle & Alicia
3. Type on Screen Exercise Review
4. Lecture: History of Web Typography
5. Rapid Crits: Everyone will do a short presentation, and we will respond [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/109QYwCZYSWacVf6G_KGvFQpHxDzLa8WoGawv2N0eX48/edit?usp=sharing)

## For Homework
1. For people who haven't picked at least one typeface for project one yet: create at least 3 mockups that explore the use of typography as it relates to your story; use no more than 2 typefaces per direction. When thinking typographically, consider type size and weight. Also consider the compositions of your type, considering hierarchy, leading, tracking, alignment, indentation, ect. We will share in class next Tuesday. 

2. For people who feel confidently  settled on their type choice, keep iterating on your sketches, move forward with one direction, creating wireframes for each section of the site, in Figma. Think about how the site will scale when resizing the window / across different screen sizes.

3. Everyone: Be able to summarize your story in 2-3 sentences, highlighting what stood out to you so that we can understand your story without having to read it. For every mockup, you should have accompanying text that justifies / explains your design decision.  
4. Read [The Web's Grain by Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/)
5. Discussion Leaders: Anjali & Jenny.
6. Everyone else writes a discussion comment or question [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pv5p2erPfjhSk7HzhXJtdSpO1effd9uR-X4lSVwFSS8/edit?usp=sharing).

# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- We’re going to start by reviewing a few of your *Semantics!* assignments. Volunteers, please!
<!-- Iris, Alicia, Angela (diff from Core 1). -->
- Let’s discuss a few things I noticed:
	- Not everyone commented their code! 😠
	- `<em>` / `<strong>` vs. `<i>` / `<b>`—which are more *semantic*? 🤔
	- `<ul>` / `<ol>` can only have `<li>` as children (nested lists are list items, too) 🙃
	- Let’s talk about `<iframe>`, briefly! With [MDN’s writeup](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe), of course. 😵‍💫
	- The `style=` attribute is CSS! 🙅‍♀️
- Okay, now it’s time for a [CSS intro](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/).


*We’ll probably take a break here. Maybe during our CSS lecture, even.*

- On to our second assignment, *Styles!*
	- We’re going to use your *Semantics!* assignment as our base. Duplicate and rename the folder in your repo.
	- You will use your `index.html` file, as-is. You are only allowed to add `id` and `class` attributes—no other HTML/restructuring! (Unless is it to correct one of the things we discussed, above.)
	- First, pull in the [reset](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/#resets). This will clear all the *user-agent* styles. We are designers; we want control.
	- Make a `style.css` in the new folder, and link it in your `<head>`.
	- Now style your page, covering/using (at least) the CSS we went [over today]([CSS intro](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/))—adjusting the type and color properties.
	- You can use what CSS you remember beyond this, but it is not required.
	- Bring in two different custom/external fonts, using `@font-face` and Google Fonts.
	- Use at least the [basic three](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/#basic-selectors) different types of CSS selectors: element type, `class`, and `id`.
	- In addition, make use of both [pseudo-classes](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/#pseudo-classes) and [pseudo-elements](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/#pseudo-elements).
	- Add a link to this page on your repo’s main/landing page, as we did before.
- I will start us off again, and then while folks are working will be available for questions/help. Let’s see how this goes.


## For next week
- You will finish your *Styles!* assignment, above. Be sure to meet *all* of the requirements listed!
- Share a link to it in Discord, when you are done.
- Also, prep for meeting about your project, next week. I am going to schedule time with each of you, to look through your code and help with your questions.
-  Come ready with these, so our time together is productive! I think we’ll treat this mainly as a working session.
