# Tuesday, Studio
## Agenda
1. Share a design that you're inspired by! - Helen
2. Reading discussion, led by Michelle & Alicia
3. Type on Screen Exercise Review
4. Lecture: History of Web Typography
5. Rapid Crits: Everyone will do a short presentation, and we will respond [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/109QYwCZYSWacVf6G_KGvFQpHxDzLa8WoGawv2N0eX48/edit?usp=sharing)

## For Homework
1. For people who haven't picked at least one typeface for project one yet: create at least 3 mockups that explore the use of typography as it relates to your story; use no more than 2 typefaces per direction. When thinking typographically, consider type size and weight. Also consider the compositions of your type, considering hierarchy, leading, tracking, alignment, indentation, ect. We will share in class next Tuesday. 

2. For people who feel confidently  settled on their type choice, keep iterating on your sketches, move forward with one direction, creating wireframes for each section of the site, in Figma. Think about how the site will scale when resizing the window / across different screen sizes.

3. Everyone: Be able to summarize your story in 2-3 sentences, highlighting what stood out to you so that we can understand your story without having to read it. For every mockup, you should have accompanying text that justifies / explains your design decision.  
4. Read [The Web's Grain by Frank Chimero](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2015/the-webs-grain/)
5. Discussion Leaders: Anjali & Jenny.
6. Everyone else writes a discussion comment or question [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pv5p2erPfjhSk7HzhXJtdSpO1effd9uR-X4lSVwFSS8/edit?usp=sharing).
