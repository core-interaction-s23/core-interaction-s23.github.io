## For Homework
1. Work on your sites! We'll be doing final crits on Tuesday. Remember, in this project we're asking you to focus on typography, so consider how typography is used on your site before focusing too much on any fancy interactions. 
2. Deliverables for Tuesday
- A working link to your site.
- A deck that summarizes your design thinking and process.
- Make sure you submit these on Canvas.
3. For the deck give us...
- A summary of your story.
- What your concept / approach was for telling that story through design. 
- Tell us about your typeface choice and typographic decisions you made.
- Tell us about the interactions you chose.
- How do the pages scale?
- Show us some iterations / Figma prototypes.
- Show us the working site.
- Tell us what you struggled with and what you would do if you had more time. 
4. Here is a [list of design considerations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWu7UrKzHBO1V47_rMvFUppg8iq0PcYmer41Advh4mI/edit?usp=sharing) / what I am the people leading the crit will be thinking about when viewing your work.

# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Today is primarily aÂ *working/<wbr>question/<wbr>answer*Â  session for your first projects. Letâ€™s try it out!
- ~~Before we get into it, letâ€™s briefly look at a few of your *Styles!* assignments.~~
- Couple things Iâ€™ve noticed:
	- *Engagement!*
	- Reiterate [resets](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/#resets)â€”lots of broken URLs, or notÂ included
	- Talk about local/remote fonts (aka: checking on other computers)
- Then Iâ€™m going to meet with you individually. We will have about 10Â minutes, each. (IÂ am going to set a timer, to keep roughly on track.) When it is your turn, please come up to the front. Spend aÂ minute or two telling me about your story, interpretation, and concept. Then letâ€™s look at your <nobr>in-progress</nobr> workâ€”send your URL in the lab channelâ€”and go through your questions. Weâ€™ll focus on the coded progress, but can dip into Figma if needed. In no particular order:

	- Ren
	- Kali
	- Alicia
	- Angela
	- Jake
	- Iris
	- Julie

	\
	*Take a little break here, 10:15ish.*

	- Michelle
	- Jenny
	- Anjali
	- Hailey <!-- Can work on/discuss Semantics/Style assignments. -->
	- Rose
	- Alice
	- Helen
	- Tanishka

- If it is not your turn, IÂ expect you to be working on your project! (And preparing your questions forÂ your turn.) IfÂ IÂ see common things coming up, we will regroup together. Iâ€™ll have the recording going, too.

## For next week
- Finish your first projects! âœŠ
- For Friday/Lab, IÂ want you to pick out 3Â works of art that weâ€™ll use for our next assignment.
	- They should be *non-representational*â€”so no photos or paintings. Think posters, abstract art, minimalism, geometricÂ forms.
	- Here [are](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/189312) [some](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/122104) [examples](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/65882) [that](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79816?sov_referrer=art_term&art_term_slug=de-stijl) [would](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7734?artist_id=2697&page=1&sov_referrer=artist) [work](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80528).
	- Make sure it is something where you can *credit* the original author, andÂ link toÂ more information about theÂ work.
	- When youâ€™ve found ones you like, share aÂ link to them in the Discord!
