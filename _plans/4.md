## For Homework

2. Deliverables for Tuesday
- A working link to your site.
- A deck that summarizes your design thinking and process.
- Make sure you submit these on Canvas.
3. For the deck give us...
- A summary of your story.
- What your concept / approach was for telling that story through design. 
- Tell us about your typeface choice and typographic decisions you made.
- Tell us about the interactions you chose.
- How do the pages scale?
- Show us some iterations / Figma prototypes.
- Show us the working site.
- Tell us what you struggled with and what you would do if you had more time. 
4. Here is a [list of design considerations](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TWu7UrKzHBO1V47_rMvFUppg8iq0PcYmer41Advh4mI/edit?usp=sharing) / what I am the people leading the crit will be thinking about when viewing your work.

# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Today is primarily a *working/<wbr>question/<wbr>answer*  session for your first projects. Let’s try it out!
- ~~Before we get into it, let’s briefly look at a few of your *Styles!* assignments.~~
- Couple things I’ve noticed:
	- *Engagement!*
	- Reiterate [resets](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/#resets)—lots of broken URLs, or not included
	- Talk about local/remote fonts (aka: checking on other computers)
- Then I’m going to meet with you individually. We will have about 10 minutes, each. (I am going to set a timer, to keep roughly on track.) When it is your turn, please come up to the front. Spend a minute or two telling me about your story, interpretation, and concept. Then let’s look at your <nobr>in-progress</nobr> work—send your URL in the lab channel—and go through your questions. We’ll focus on the coded progress, but can dip into Figma if needed. In no particular order:

	- Ren
	- Kali
	- Alicia
	- Angela
	- Jake
	- Iris
	- Julie

	\
	*Take a little break here, 10:15ish.*

	- Michelle
	- Jenny
	- Anjali
	- Hailey <!-- Can work on/discuss Semantics/Style assignments. -->
	- Rose
	- Alice
	- Helen
	- Tanishka

- If it is not your turn, I expect you to be working on your project! (And preparing your questions for your turn.) If I see common things coming up, we will regroup together. I’ll have the recording going, too.

## For next week
- Finish your first projects! ✊
- For Friday/Lab, I want you to pick out 3 works of art that we’ll use for our next assignment.
	- They should be *non-representational*—so no photos or paintings. Think posters, abstract art, minimalism, geometric forms.
	- Here [are](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/189312) [some](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/122104) [examples](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/65882) [that](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/79816?sov_referrer=art_term&art_term_slug=de-stijl) [would](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/7734?artist_id=2697&page=1&sov_referrer=artist) [work](https://www.moma.org/collection/works/80528).
	- Make sure it is something where you can *credit* the original author, and link to more information about the work.
	- When you’ve found ones you like, share a link to them in the Discord!
