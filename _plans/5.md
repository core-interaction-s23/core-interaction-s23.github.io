4. Come in with three different ideas for the contents of your elastic collection. The content can be any type of media – photos, videos, animations, audio. For each idea, include a a written description of the contents, highlight your interest in it, three possible stories one could develop from this collection (does it connect to any broader discussions in visual culture, design, or beyond?), as well as an example of the visual component of the object. This can be done in Figma, in Google Slides, or a PDF.



# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Let’s regroup on the next few weeks! *Roughly: layout, responsive design, JavaScript.*
- Then our *entrée* for today: let’s refresh our understanding of [the box model](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/box-model/).

*This will probably take us up to our break.*

- We won’t have time during class to go into these in-depth, but we’ll take a quick glance at [flexbox](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/flexbox/) and [(CSS) grid](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/grid/).

	\
	Think of these as your *leftovers*. Have them for lunch tomorrow, and this weekend!

- Then we’ll go through our next assignment, *Layout!*
	- You will be using the three artworks you (should) have selected and shared, recreating (approximating) them in HTML/CSS.
	- Create a new folder `layout` in your repo, with its own `index.html` and `style.css`.
	- On this page, you will make a “gallery” of your three works. (Here is a [previous example](https://mfehrenbach.github.io/little-boxes/).)
	- Using only HTML elements and CSS properties, you will “draw” each of your artworks. You can also use text—but *no* images!
	- You should, at minimum, make use of [basic CSS](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/css/) and today’s [box model](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/box-model/) material. You can also use what you remember of [Flex](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/flexbox/) and [Grid](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/grid/), too. (Plus anything else in your grab-bag, of course.)
	- Think of HTML elements as your “daubs of paint.” If you need to make a mark, make an element.
	- Since these are primarily visual elements, non-semantic containers (like `div`) would be appropriate. But use semantic tags (like `figure`) outside, where it makes sense.
	- It will also be helpful to “break down” your artwork into nested rectangles—in order to have more control over the layout. Think [bento boxes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento)—rectangles within rectangles.
	- I would also draw your attention to CSS [transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform) (we looked at these briefly last week) and also [filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/filter), too. You could also use [clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path), but don’t go crazy there. (I don’t want you to learn `clip-path`; I want you to learn CSS layout.)
	- Many of you chose *organic* (not geometric) forms—which will be harder to recreate in HTML/CSS. But you can’t switch your artworks—instead think about how you can *interpret* these forms in a new medium. Think (literally) outside the box!
	- I am not expecting [Diana Smith](https://diana-adrianne.com) level of fidelity—but I am expecting *engagement*. Sometimes [approximations](https://twitter.com/dz/status/991365966553591808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E991365966553591808%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwistedsifter.com%2F2019%2F11%2Fpainting-with-css-and-html-by-diana-smith%2F) are [better](https://twitter.com/mdotslash/status/991510235989721088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E991510235989721088%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Ftwistedsifter.com%2F2019%2F11%2Fpainting-with-css-and-html-by-diana-smith%2F)! Just as a reminder, you cannot fake *engagement*.
	- Include a [*tombstone*](https://harvardartmuseums.org/article/writing-on-the-wall) for each artwork—the artist, title, and date.
	- Provide a link to the original source for your artwork!
	- And be sure to link to this page from your landing/main site.



## For next week
- You will finish your *Layout!* assignment, above. Again, be sure you meet *all* the requirements listed out.
- Share a link to it in Discord when you are done!
