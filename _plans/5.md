# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Let’s regroup on the next few weeks! *Roughly: layout, responsive design, JavaScript.*
- Then our *entrée* for today: let’s refresh our understanding of [the box model](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/box-model/).

*This will probably take us up to our break.*

- We won’t have time during class to go into these in-depth, but we’ll take a quick glance at [flexbox](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/flexbox/) and [(CSS) grid](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/grid/).

	\
	Think of these as your *leftovers*. Have them for lunch tomorrow, and this weekend!
