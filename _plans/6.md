# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- We’ll start off by reviewing a few of your *Layout!* assignments. Volunteers!
	<!-- Michelle, Tanishka’s gridded one. -->
- Some things I noticed:
	- Nesting/hierarchy, like `figure`
	- `position: relative;` as reference for `absolute` <!-- Anjali’s example: https://anjaliarasas.github.io/exercises/exercise-5/index.html -->
	- Reminder to meet all the requirements! (Tombstones.)
- Today we’re going to talk about [media queries](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/responsive/). (Again, sorry.)

*We’ll take a lil’ break here.*
