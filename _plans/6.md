## Homework
1. Continue iterating on your data collection. Try focusing on one direction and making a list of all the possible questions this data brings up. What kind of data is it?

Think about how the data will be displayed or arranged, and what is the interaction that will tell you more about each object in the collection.

# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- We’ll start off by reviewing a few of your *Layout!* assignments. These were so great! Volunteers!
	<!-- Michelle, Tanishka’s gridded one, Kali’s Rothko. -->
- Some things I noticed:
	- Nesting/hierarchy, like `figure`
	- `position: relative;` as reference for `absolute` <!-- Anjali’s example: https://anjaliarasas.github.io/exercises/exercise-5/index.html -->
	- Reminder to meet all the requirements! (Tombstones.)
- Today we’re going to talk about [media queries](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/responsive/). (Again, sorry.)

*We’ll take a lil’ break here.*

- Then we’ll talk briefly about [DevTools (The Inspector)](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/inspector/)—through the lens of “how to work responsively.”
- And then on to our next assignment, *Responsive!*
	- Create a new folder `responsive` in your repo, with its own `index.html` and `style.css`.
	- Select one of your artworks from last week. (This will be easiest with the most simple one!)
	- Copy in your HTML and CSS for this single work, removing the other two.
	- You are now going to make this work *responsive!*
	- Add the magic `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">` to your `<head>`.
	- Leave your HTML as-is. We will be working only in CSS!
	- Remove any and all [absolute units](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/box-model/#absolute-length-units) from your code, replacing them with CSS variables and relative values. I shouldn’t see any `px` in this assignment!
	- Revise these relative values (and the overall page layout, as necessary) to display your artwork “correctly” at `375 ✕ 628` in your DevTools.
	- All of these CSS variables should be in `:root`. *Mobile-first!*
	- After you have made your work “accurate” (to what it was before) here, you will add two width-based media queries: one at `600` and another at `1200`.
	- Use these media queries to adjust/modify/tweak/*remix* your artwork!
	- You should *not* change any actual properties in these queries—you are only allowed to adjust the *values* for your CSS variables.
	- You can change the color, spacing, transforms, even `z-index`. Any value; no properties!
	- The work should be unique and distinct at all three of your breakpoints: mobile (`:root`), `600`, and `1200`.
	- Add a link to this page on your main landing, as we do.



## For next week

- You are to finish your *Responsive!* assignment! I will, again (again), remind you to read all the instructions/requirements and make sure you have met them.
- Share it on Discord, when you are done!
