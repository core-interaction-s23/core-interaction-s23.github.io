# Tuesday, Studio
## Agenda

1. Ren to share design inspo.
2. Hear from Helen about Can the Internet Be Archived?
3. Lecture: [Data Sharing for the Public Good](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-mb9Fr2fFb6pMnFRXwMj63QTYnwmzg-nUqNVveov8-I/edit?usp=sharing)
4. Review Animation Exercise. Turn into Canvas if you haven't already. 
5. One on ones continued.

## Homework
1. At this point you should have picked one data collection direction to focus on. We will be sharing initial wireframes of your sites on Thursday. Make a presentation using a tool of your choice that outlines what your collection is and what are the 5 different data attributes you can highlight for each object in the collection. For example, if your collection is lamps, the data associated with the lamp could be the image, where it's from, what color it is, what era it's from, does it have a lampshade or not?, Is it a floor lamp or a desk lamp, ect... Lastly you should start thinking about how your collection will be organized and sorted from a UX perspective. Does it use grid or flexbox? What happens when you click on an individual object. And of course, think about what type you might use. 
2. Reading: [Data Feminism: Collect, Analyze, Imagine, Teach](https://data-feminism.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ei7cogfn/release/4) — Catherine D’Ignazio and Lauren Klein - Due Tuesday, March 22

# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Let’s look at a couple of your *Responsive!* assignments. Who wants to go?
	<!-- Anjali, Rose, Julie. -->
- Couple things I noticed:
	- Don’t change *properties/values* in the media queries—just change the *variables*. I swear this will be easier!
	- Mind your `vh` (viewport *height*) vs. `vw` (viewport *width*). You (probably) want `vw` for most things! Since widths vary more.
- Our main jam for today is [an intro to JavaScript](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/javascript/). We’ll come at it from my perspective, which is *as a designer*.

*We’ll take our break after this.*

- I think we’ll go in-depth on this later, but let’s talk briefly about [working with images](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/images/). This will come up in your projects!
- And then we’ll go through a [template repo](https://github.com/core-interaction-s23/collection) I put together for your projects:
	- Pull it down. You can use it to start your work.
	- Talk briefly about [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), for *JavaScript Object Notation*. (No trailing commas!)
	- Let’s look at the `collection.json` data for this demo. (Kubrick is my favorite director.)
	- These are often provided by an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API), for *Application Programming Interface*. Basically, you ask for data from a server and it returns one of these to you. Here’s [an Are.na one](https://api.are.na/v2/channels/typography-and-interaction-too), as an example.
	- Some other common *structured data* formats are [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) (yuck) and [YML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) (yum).
	- By default, browsers don’t “speak” JSON—you can install [an extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter) for easier readability.
	- Let’s look at the example `collection.js`! It is also `// Commented`, too.
	- Look, modern [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions)!
	- Any time we’re doing something over and over, you’ll probably use a [forEach](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) loop.
	- And [template literals/strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals), combining our JS objects/data with HTML.
	- For the adventurous, the [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch)!



## For next week

- Get your project data in JSON, and outputting DOM using the example repo. Share a link to this on Discord, when you are done! This will double as your assignment for next class.
- Our next class will be mostly 1:1 check-ins on your projects, as we did last time.
- Come prepared with your questions—conceptual, design, or technical!
- Have a good, relaxing break!
