# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Today will be a *working/<wbr>question/<wbr>answer*  session for your second projects, as we discussed.
- Before that though, let’s talk about your *progress reports*:
	- I compiled these over our break and have them ready. However, apparently the school does not “turn on” our mid-semester Starfish surveys until *Monday*. 🤷‍♀️
	- So I will be entering these in when that is available, next week. I believe it emails you when they are ready.
	- For folks with attendance or grade concerns, I have “raised a flag” in Starfish ahead of that, and (again, it’s my understanding) you should have been notified.
	- If you’d like to know your grade/feedback before the survey, direct message me on Discord!
- Let’s also briefly make sure we understand *assignments*:
	- When something is in the *“For next week”* section on here, it is due by the start of class next week.
	- As we’ve discussed (unless otherwise noted), you “turn in” assignments by sharing the URL in our Discord.
	- Per [CD policies](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u358io8doX_SVVMGqIM_oH5V0OIccneYu4Ww-uE55QM/edit#heading=h.64moyiwmpq3g), *we don’t accept late work*.
	- Assignments are [most of your grade](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15qyoAy0IGI4u2gmBAw6ZepMuHco0_VZf6MGGW97Y8J4/edit#heading=h.q4ilgwf7xr97).
	- That all said, I don’t want to be a fascist here—you can talk to me.
	- As of writing, ~~nobody~~ less than half have shared their *JSON!* assignment from last class! What’s going on here?
- Okay, on to projects. We will have about 10 minutes each, again—when it is your turn, come up to the front like we did last time. We can talk concept, design, code, JSON—whatever you need. Today’s random draw:

	- Tanishka
	- Julie
	- Alicia
	- Michelle
	- Hailey
	- Angela
	- Kali

	\
	*Take a little break here, 10:15ish.*

	- Jenny
	- Alice
	- Iris
	- Ren
	- Jake
	- Rose
	- Helen
	- Anjali

- If it is not your turn, I expect you to be working on your project! I’ll speak to the whole group again, as common things come up.



## For next week

- Finish your projects! 🫡
- Depending on the answer (above) about the *JSON!* assignment, I might have you do this for Lab, next week. I want to make sure we aren’t glossing over it. We’ll decide together!
