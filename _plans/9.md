# Tuesday, Studio

## Agenda

1. 1-on-1 check ins on Zoom

## Homework
1. Finish your projects for critques on Thursday. Remember, if not everything is working, be able to present the designed mockups / wireframes and explain how you intend for it to look when you get all the code sorted. Please feel free to reach out to me if you're encountering any coding bugs and I will try my best to get back to you before Thursday. 

2. Some Basic info to include in your deck:
- What is your collection and what interests you about the collection? Why might this information be useful to someone else?
- Explain your process for gathering the data.
- Explain how you chose to organize the data through design.
- Show us some of the intial sketches.
- Show us the final high fidelity wireframes and explain or show each interaction.
- Show us how you considered scaling / responsiveness in your design. 
- Show us the working site
- Explain what your polishing moves would be with more time.

# Friday, Lab

## Agenda

- Quick housekeeping:
	- Everyone should have received their current/estimated grade, last week! Again, these were prior to last week/class.
	- If you are absent, it is your responsibility to check here on the course site and see what you need to do. It will always say what is expected for the next class. If you are unsure, you can message me on Discord. (*“Discord me.”*)
	- Also, you *are* still expected to complete your assignments. Remember that there is a big difference between a “0” and something incomplete, or something late—and this class is mostly assignments. Again, you can talk to me.
	- I might also announce changes on Discord, and you should be minding your notifications there. Not minding them is not an excuse for not turning something in.

- Today we’re going to revisit [working with images](https://core-interaction.github.io/lab/images/), going in-depth this time.

*We’ll take our break around 10:15.*

- And then on to our next assignment, *SVG!*
	- Select one of the original artworks from your *Layout!* assignment—it could be the one you made responsive, or one of the other two you selected.
	- You will be recreating/approximating/interpreting this work, but now within an SVG! (It won’t share any code with your previous assignment; SVGs are made differently.)
	- *If you are absolutely tired of your works, you could choose another work—but ask me first on Discord.*
	- Create a new folder `svg` in your class repo, with its own `index.html` and `style.css` for this assignment. Add your shared `reset.css`.
	- Create an `artwork.svg` in the same folder. Start with this simple SVG content, to make sure things are working:

	```
	<svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
		<rect x="0" y="0" width="100" height="100" fill="gold" />
	</svg>
	```
	- Place this SVG into your `index.html`, first as the source for an image: `<img src="artwork.svg">`
	- Before you get into the SVG, let’s situate this image in the page—give the page some structure, decide where you want the image on the page and how large it should be.
	- Add links to the artist, title, and source for the work in your HTML (as we did before).
	- Okay, on to the SVG itself! You will now remake (or remix) your artwork, using SVG as your drawing tool—using [`<circle>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/circle), [`<ellipse>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/ellipse), [`<line>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/line), [`<path>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/path), [`<polygon>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/polygon), [`<polyline>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/polyline),[`<rect>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/rect), and even [`<text>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/text) SVG elements.
	- Again, think of these as your “daubs of paint!”
	- You can use the [`<g>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/g) elements to group parts of your work together, to organize or style them as a unit.
	- Note that SVGs have slightly different syntax for their [fills and strokes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Fills_and_Strokes), [gradients](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Gradients), [filters](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Element/filter), and [transforms](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Attribute/transform).
	- You can set your width/height in the SVG itself, to approximate your artwork ratio—then scale the `img` in CSS.
	- Once you have “finished” your artwork, create another container in your DOM below the first one.
	- Here you are going to paste your SVG contents *into* the page itself—since SVGs are XML based, they can be written directly into the HTML.
	- An advantage of them being in the DOM itself is that you can target their internal elements in CSS. (This is great for UI elements, like icons! Share your CSS variables.)
	- So in your `style.css`, modify/remix/reinterpret this second artwork using CSS. You can target the SVG elements the same as you would HTML—by type, or by adding a `class` or `id`.
	- Once you have completed both SVGs (in the file, and in the page) and remixed the second—add a link to your landing page.



## For next week

- Finish your *SVG!* assignment, above! Please make sure you have met all the requirements here, <nobr>and—most</nobr> importantly—have demonstrated your engagement/experimentation!
- Share it on Discord when you are done, as we do.
